Boundaries of US counties, commuting zones, and states in R sf and sp formats,
derived from US Census Bureau cartographic boundaries.

Boundaries are provided in three resolutions

* 500k = 1:500,000
* 5m = 1:5,000,000
* 20m = 1:20,000,000

Boundaries use the WGS 84, EPSG:4326 ([epsg.io](https://epsg.io/4326))
coordinate reference system.

Boundary files use this naming convention:
`cb_year_us_region_resolution_format.rds` where

* year = 2015
* region = county, cz, state
* resolution = 500k, 5m, 20m
* format = sf, sp
